# Service Removal Error Handling Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: When user cancels password prompt during auto-mount service removal:
- Error: "Failed to remove auto-mount service for {bucket}"
- Bucket deleted in console but service remains on system
- May cause boot errors when system tries to mount deleted bucket
- No clear guidance on how to fix

**Scenario**:
1. Bucket deleted in Haio console
2. App detects deletion (within 60s)
3. App asks for password to remove systemd service
4. **User cancels password prompt** (by mistake or intentionally)
5. Service remains on system ‚Üí Boot errors later

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Graceful Password Cancellation Handling

**File**: `main_new.py`

#### Updated: `remove_systemd_service()` (Line ~1185)

**Before**:
```python
if password_dialog.exec() != QDialog.DialogCode.Accepted:
    return False  # ‚ùå Silent failure, no explanation
```

**After**:
```python
password_dialog = PasswordDialog(
    parent_widget, 
    f"System password required to remove auto-mount service for '{bucket_name}'.\n\n"
    f"Note: If you cancel, the service will remain on your system.\n"  # ‚úÖ Clear warning
    f"You can remove it manually later if needed."
)

if password_dialog.exec() != QDialog.DialogCode.Accepted:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  User cancelled password prompt for removing service: {service_name}")
    return False  # ‚úÖ Logged reason
```

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Clear warning in password dialog
- ‚úÖ Console logging when cancelled
- ‚úÖ User knows consequences

---

### 2. User-Friendly Error Message on Failure

**File**: `main_new.py` (Line ~4228)

#### Updated: `sync_bucket_stats()` deletion handling

**After**:
```python
success = self.rclone_manager.remove_auto_mount_service(...)
if success:
    print(f"‚úÖ Successfully removed auto-mount service for {bucket_name}")
else:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to remove auto-mount service for {bucket_name}")
    
    # ‚úÖ Show detailed warning dialog
    from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QMessageBox
    service_name = f"haio-{self.current_user}-{bucket_name}"
    QMessageBox.warning(
        self,
        "Service Removal Failed",
        f"Could not remove auto-mount service for '{bucket_name}'.\n\n"
        f"The bucket was deleted in the console, but the auto-mount service "
        f"remains on your system. This may cause errors on next boot.\n\n"
        f"To remove it manually, run:\n"
        f"  sudo systemctl disable {service_name}.service\n"
        f"  sudo systemctl stop {service_name}.service\n"
        f"  sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/{service_name}.service\n"
        f"  sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n"
        f"Or disable auto-mount for this bucket before deleting it."
    )
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of the problem
- ‚úÖ Exact commands to fix manually
- ‚úÖ Advice for future (disable auto-mount first)
- ‚úÖ Bucket still removed from UI (doesn't block)

---

### 3. Better Command Execution Logging

**File**: `main_new.py` (Line ~1218)

**Before**:
```python
for cmd in commands:
    subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Continue even if some commands fail
```

**After**:
```python
commands = [
    (f'echo "{password}" | sudo -S systemctl disable "{service_name}"', "Disabling service"),
    (f'echo "{password}" | sudo -S systemctl stop "{service_name}"', "Stopping service"),
    (f'echo "{password}" | sudo -S rm -f "{self.service_dir}/{service_name}"', "Removing service file"),
    (f'echo "{password}" | sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload', "Reloading systemd")
]

all_success = True
for cmd, description in commands:
    print(f"  {description}...")
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=10)
    if result.returncode != 0 and result.stderr:
        # Check if it's just "not found" error
        if 'No such file' not in result.stderr and 'not loaded' not in result.stderr:
            print(f"    ‚ö†Ô∏è  {description} failed: {result.stderr.strip()}")
            all_success = False
        else:
            print(f"    ‚ÑπÔ∏è  {description}: Service already removed")
    else:
        print(f"    ‚úÖ {description} completed")

return all_success
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step progress logging
- ‚úÖ Distinguishes between real errors and "already removed"
- ‚úÖ Returns success/failure status accurately
- ‚úÖ Timeout protection (10s per command)

### 4. Manual Cleanup Script

**New File**: `cleanup_services.sh`

Standalone bash script to clean up leftover services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Scan for Haio auto-mount services
# Offer to remove them interactively
# Handle both user and system services

./cleanup_services.sh
```

**Features**:
- üîç Scans `~/.config/systemd/user/` for user services
- üîç Scans `/etc/systemd/system/` for system services
- üìã Lists all found services with status (enabled/disabled)
- üßπ Removes services interactively or with confirmation
- ‚úÖ Handles both user and system services
- üìù Shows summary of removed/failed services

**Example Output**:
```
============================================================
Haio Smart App - Manual Auto-Mount Service Cleanup
============================================================

  ‚Üì
Status: "‚úì Removed 1 deleted bucket(s)"
```

---

### Scenario B: User Cancels Password

```
Bucket deleted in console
  ‚Üì
App detects (within 60s)
  ‚Üì
Password dialog: 
  "System password required to remove auto-mount service for 'mybucket'.
   
   Note: If you cancel, the service will remain on your system.
   You can remove it manually later if needed."
  ‚Üì
User clicks Cancel ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
Console:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  User cancelled password prompt for removing service: haio-user-mybucket.service
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to remove auto-mount service for mybucket
  ‚Üì
Warning Dialog:
  "Service Removal Failed
   
   Could not remove auto-mount service for 'mybucket'.
   
   The bucket was deleted in the console, but the auto-mount service
   remains on your system. This may cause errors on next boot.
   
   To remove it manually, run:
     sudo systemctl disable haio-user-mybucket.service
     sudo systemctl stop haio-user-mybucket.service
     sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/haio-user-mybucket.service
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   
   Or disable auto-mount for this bucket before deleting it."
  ‚Üì
User clicks OK
  ‚Üì
Bucket removed from UI ‚úÖ (doesn't block removal)
  ‚Üì
Status: "‚úì Removed 1 deleted bucket(s)"
  ‚Üì
Later: User runs cleanup script or manual commands
```

---

## Manual Cleanup Options

### Option 1: Use Cleanup Script (Easiest)

```bash
cd /path/to/haio/smarthaioapp/client
./cleanup_services.sh
```

Interactive, scans and removes all Haio services.

---

### Option 2: Manual Commands (Expert)

```bash
# List services
systemctl --user list-units | grep haio
sudo systemctl list-units | grep haio

# Remove specific service
SERVICE_NAME="haio-user-mybucket.service"

# If it's a user service:
systemctl --user disable $SERVICE_NAME
systemctl --user stop $SERVICE_NAME
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/$SERVICE_NAME
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# If it's a system service:
sudo systemctl disable $SERVICE_NAME
sudo systemctl stop $SERVICE_NAME
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/$SERVICE_NAME
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

### Option 3: Disable Auto-Mount First (Prevention)

**Before deleting bucket in console**:
1. Open Haio Smart App
2. Find the bucket
3. Uncheck "Auto-mount at boot"
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Now delete bucket in console
6. No cleanup needed! ‚úÖ
