## Decision Summary

### ‚ùì Should we convert to .NET?
### ‚úÖ NO - Stay with Python/PyQt6

**Why stay with Python:**
1. ‚úÖ All issues fixed
2. ‚úÖ Better cross-platform
3. ‚úÖ Easier Android path
4. ‚úÖ Faster development
5. ‚úÖ No rewrite needed
6. ‚úÖ Same/better results

**Why not .NET:**
1. ‚ùå 4-8 weeks to rewrite
2. ‚ùå Breaks Linux support
3. ‚ùå Doesn't fix mounting (rclone issue)
4. ‚ùå Worse for Android
5. ‚ùå No real benefits

## Future Roadmap

### Next Week:
- [ ] Test on actual Windows machine
- [ ] Test mount stability with slow network
- [ ] Add user preference for monitoring interval
- [ ] Add tray icon support

### Next Month:
- [ ] Design mobile app UI/UX
- [ ] Choose mobile framework (Flutter recommended)
- [ ] Build mobile app prototype
- [ ] Add notifications system

### Future:
- [ ] Credentials encryption
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Multiple admin server support
- [ ] Bandwidth limiting options
- [ ] Transfer statistics
- [ ] Multi-language support

---

## Android App Plan

### Recommendation: Build Separate Mobile App

**Best Option: Flutter**
- Fast, modern UI
- Single codebase (iOS + Android)
- Excellent documentation
- Great performance

**Architecture:**
```
Backend API (Python - already exists)
         ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
Desktop   Mobile
(PyQt6)   (Flutter)
```

**Why Not Port PyQt6:**
- PyQt6 doesn't work well on Android
- Mobile needs different UI/UX
- File system access is different
- Better to use mobile-native tools

---

## Support

### If Issues Occur:

1. **Check logs first:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/haio-mounter/app.log
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   python test_improvements.py
   ```

3. **Read documentation:**
   - SUMMARY.md
   - IMPROVEMENTS.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md

4. **Check dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   rclone version
   ```
