   # Windows
   setup_windows.bat
   ```

3. **Run from source**:

## Automated Releases

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated building and releasing:

### Release Workflow

- **Triggers**: When you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Builds**: Windows and Linux executables automatically
- **Releases**: Creates GitHub release with downloadable binaries

To create a new release:

```bash
# Tag your commit with a version
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will automatically:
1. Build Windows executable with bundled rclone
2. Build Linux executable with bundled rclone  
3. Create GitHub release with both binaries
4. Generate release notes

### Test Build Workflow

- **Triggers**: On pull requests and pushes to main/develop branches
- **Purpose**: Validates that the application builds successfully on both platforms
- **No releases**: Only tests the build process

### Manual Triggers

Both workflows can be manually triggered from the GitHub Actions tab in your repository.

## Architecture

### Main Components

- **`main_new.py`**: Complete Haio Drive Client with modern PyQt6 GUI
- **`RcloneManager`**: Cross-platform rclone integration and dependency checking
- **`PasswordDialog`**: GUI password prompts for system operations
- **`setup_*.sh/bat`**: Automated dependency installation scripts

### Dependencies

- **PyQt6**: Modern GUI framework
- **rclone**: Cloud storage mounting (auto-downloaded during build)
- **FUSE/WinFsp**: Filesystem drivers for mounting
- **requests**: HTTP client for API communication

### Build System

- **PyInstaller**: Creates standalone executables
- **Cross-platform**: Single spec file works on Windows and Linux
- **Dependency bundling**: All Python packages included
- **External tools**: rclone automatically downloaded and bundled

## Configuration

The application stores configuration in:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/haio-drive-client/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\haio-drive-client`

Mount points are created in:
- **Linux**: `~/haio-mounts/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\haio-mounts`

## Contributing

### For Developers

#### Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch
2. **Make changes** and test locally with `python main_new.py`
3. **Build and test** executables with `./build.sh` or `build.bat`
4. **Submit** a pull request to the `main` branch

#### Creating Releases

This project uses automated GitHub Actions workflows for building and releasing binaries:

##### Release Process

1. **Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to main**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new version tag (semantic versioning)
   git tag v1.3.0
   
   # Push the tag to trigger automated release
   git push origin v1.3.0
   ```

3. **Automated build process will**:
   - Build Windows executable (`HaioSmartApp.exe`) with bundled rclone
   - Build Linux executable (`HaioSmartApp`) with bundled rclone
   - Create GitHub release with both binaries
   - Generate automatic release notes

##### Manual Release Trigger

You can also manually trigger a release from GitHub:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select **"Build and Release"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Choose the branch and click **"Run workflow"**

##### Release Workflow Details

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) includes:
- **Cross-platform builds** on Windows and Linux runners
- **Automatic dependency management** (downloads latest rclone)
- **Executable packaging** with PyInstaller
- **GitHub release creation** with proper permissions
- **Artifact uploads** for distribution

##### Version Tags

Use semantic versioning for tags:
- `v1.0.0` - Major releases with breaking changes
- `v1.1.0` - Minor releases with new features
- `v1.1.1` - Patch releases with bug fixes

##### Build Testing

The test workflow (`.github/workflows/test-build.yml`) runs automatically on:
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pushes to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual triggers from GitHub Actions

This ensures all changes build successfully before merging.
